        <h2 id="fundaOfPython">Chapter 1: The Fundamentals of Python</h2>
        <p>
            Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language, was conceived in the late 1980s and has since gained
            immense popularity. Known for its clear and concise syntax, Python is a versatile language used for a
            variety of
            applications. In this chapter, we will cover the foundational aspects of Python programming.

        </p>
        <h3>Understanding Python:</h3>
        <p>
            Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and its use of significant whitespace. This
            whitespace-driven approach enhances code readability and minimizes common programming errors. Python's
            syntax
            allows developers to express their ideas concisely and clearly.
        </p>

        <h3>Setting Up Python:</h3>
        <p>
            Before diving into programming, you need to set up your development environment. Python is available for
            various
            platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download and install Python from the official
            website,
            and many platforms even come with Python pre-installed.
        </p>

    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="css">

        <h3>Your First Python Program:</h3>
        <p>Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program. Open a text editor or an integrated development
            environment
            (IDE), type the following code, and save it as hello.py:
        </p>

        <!-- img -->
        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py1.png' %}" alt="">

        <p>
            To run the program, open a terminal, navigate to the directory where hello.py is saved, and enter:
        </p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py2.png' %}" alt="">

        <p>
            Congratulations! You've just executed your first Python program.
        </p>

    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="css">

        <h3>Variables and Data Types:</h3>
        <p>In Python, variables are used to store data values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is
            dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the variable's type explicitly. Python automatically
            determines the type based on the assigned value.
            <br>

            Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and
            more.
            For example:
        </p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py3.png' %}" alt="">



    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="css">

        <h3>Basic Operators:</h3>
        <p>Python supports a wide range of operators for performing operations on variables and values. These include
            arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <,==, !=), logical operators (and, or, not), and
                more. </p>

                <h3>Control Structures:</h3>
                <p>Control structures allow you to dictate the flow of your program based on conditions. Python offers
                    if,
                    elif, and else statements for conditional execution, as well as for and while loops for iterative
                    processes.

                </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="css">

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>
            In this introductory chapter, we've explored the basics of Python programming. You've learned how to
            set
            up your environment, write and execute a simple Python program, work with variables and data types,

    <div class="css">
        <h3>Conditional Statements: If, Elif, and Else</h3>
        <p>
            Conditional statements allow you to execute specific code blocks based on conditions. The if statement
            is the most basic form, followed by elif (short for "else if") and else. These statements enable your
            program to make decisions and choose different paths of execution.</p>


        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py4.png' %}" alt="">

    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="css">

        <h3>Loops: For and While</h3>
        <p>Loops are essential for performing repetitive tasks without writing redundant code. Python provides two
            main
            types of loops: for loops and while loops.
        </p>

        <h3>For Loops</h3>
        <p>The for loop allows you to iterate over a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string. This is useful when
            you want to perform an action on each element of the sequence.</p>


        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py5.png' %}" alt="">

        <h3>While Loops</h3>
        <p>A while loop continues executing a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. Be
            cautious
            with while loops to avoid infinite loops.</p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py6.png' %}" alt="">


    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="css">

        <h3>Break and Continue Statements</h3>
        <p>In loops, you can use the break statement to exit the loop prematurely, even if the loop's condition
            hasn't
            been met. On the other hand, the continue statement allows you to skip the current iteration and proceed
            to
            the next one.
        </p>

        <h3>Nested Loops</h3>
        <p>Python allows you to nest loops within each other, creating complex patterns and iterating through
            multidimensional data structures like lists of lists.</p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py7.png' %}" alt="">


    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="css">

        <h3> Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Control structures and loops are essential tools in a programmer's toolbox. With conditional statements,
            you
            can make decisions and tailor your program's behavior, while loops help you perform repetitive tasks
            efficiently.

            In this chapter, you've explored if, elif, and else statements for conditional execution, as well as for
            and
            while loops for iteration. Additionally, you've learned how to use the break and continue statements to
            control the flow of loops.

            As you continue your journey through this book, you'll build upon these foundational concepts,
            incorporating
            them into more complex programs and applications. In Chapter 3, we'll delve into functions and modules,
            which will enhance your code's modularity and reusability.

        <h3>List Comprehensions</h3>
        <p>
            List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing sequences or other iterable
            objects.
        </p>

    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="css">

        <h3>Tuples: Immutable Collections</h3>
        <p>
            Similar to lists, tuples allow you to store a collection of items. However, tuples are immutable,
            meaning
            their contents cannot be changed after creation.
        </p>


        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py17.png' %}" alt="">

        <h3>Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs</h3>
        <p>
            Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. They are unordered and allow you to quickly retrieve
            values
            based on their keys.
        </p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py18.png' %}" alt="">

        <h3>
            Sets: Unordered Unique Elements
        </h3>
        <p>
            Sets are collections of unique elements. They are particularly useful when you need to store distinct
            values
            and perform set operations.
        </p>

        <h3>Understanding Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects.
            Objects are instances of classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects with defined attributes
            (variables) and behaviors (methods).
        </p>

        <h3>
            Defining Classes
        </h3>
        <p>
            In Python, you can define a class using the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon.
            Inside
            the class, you can define attributes (variables) and methods (functions).
        </p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py21.png' %}" alt="">
        <br>
        <code>
    class Person: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def __init__(self, name, age):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.name = name<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.age = age<br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def greet(self):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.")<br>

</code>
        <br>

    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="css">

        <h3>Creating Objects</h3>
        <p>
            Once you've defined a class, you can create objects (instances) of that class using the class
            constructor.
        </p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py22.png' %}" alt="">

        <p>
            Accessing Attributes and Methods
            You can access an object's attributes and methods using dot notation.
        </p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py23.png' %}" alt="">

        <h3>
            Inheritance: Extending Classes
        </h3>
        <p>
            Inheritance allows you to create a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class
            (base class). This promotes code reuse and supports the creation of specialized classes.
        </p>


        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py24.png' %}" alt="">

        <h3>Polymorphism: One Interface, Multiple Implementations</h3>
        <p>
            Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This
            allows you to write code that can work with different types of objects in a unified way.

        <h3> Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            In this chapter, you've embarked on a journey into the realm of object-oriented programming (OOP) in
            Python.
            You've learned how to define classes, create objects, access attributes and methods, utilize inheritance
            for

        <h3>Understanding Errors</h3>
        <p>
            Errors are an inevitable part of programming. They can occur due to syntax mistakes, logical flaws, or
            unexpected data. Python provides mechanisms to handle and manage these errors effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Errors</h3>
        <p>
            There are three main types of errors in Python:
        </p>

        <h3>Syntax Errors:</h3>
        <p>
            These occur when you violate the rules of the Python language. They are often caught by the
            Python interpreter when you try to execute the code.
        </p>

        <h3>Runtime Errors (Exceptions):</h3>
        <p> These errors occur during the execution of the code and are usually related to
            unforeseen circumstances, such as division by zero or trying to access an index that doesn't exist.</p>

        <h3>Logical Errors:</h3>
        <p>
            These errors do not generate error messages, but they result in incorrect behavior of the
            program. They can be challenging to identify and debug.
        </p>

    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="css">

        <h3>Handling Exceptions</h3>
        <p>
            Python provides a structured way to handle exceptions using try, except, else, and finally blocks.

        </p>

        <img src="{% static 'images/python-image/py27.png' %}" alt="">

        <h3>Debugging Techniques</h3>
        <p>
            Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors in your code. Here are some techniques to help
            you
            debug effectively:
        </p>

        <h3>Print Statements:</h3>
        <p>
            Insert print statements at critical points in your code to monitor variable values and
            execution flow.
        </p>

        <h3>Using a Debugger:</h3>
        <p> Python provides built-in debugging tools, such as the pdb module, which allows you to set
            breakpoints and step through your code.
        </p>
        <h3>Logging:</h3>
        <p>
            Utilize the logging module to create detailed logs that help you track the flow of your program.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Code Reviews:</h3> Having someone else review your code can provide fresh insights and catch errors you
        might
        have missed.
        </p>

        <h3>Handling Common Errors</h3>
        <h3>Some common errors you might encounter include:</h3>

        <p><b>NameError: </b>Trying to use a variable before it's defined.
            <b>TypeError:</b> Operating on incompatible data types.
            <b>IndexError:</b> Accessing an index that doesn't exist in a list or tuple.
            <b>ValueError:</b> Function arguments have valid types, but invalid values.
            <b>KeyError:</b> Accessing a dictionary key that doesn't exist.
            <b>FileNotFoundError:</b> Attempting to open a file that doesn't exist.
        </p>

    </div>
